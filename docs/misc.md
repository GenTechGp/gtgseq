# Miscellaneous

This document briefly descibe what is in the [https://gtgseq.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#misc](https://gtgseq.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#ont-rna004-rna/) directory. 
Note that you should be familiar with the information documented in the [README](../README.md) and the [datasets](datasets.md) before going through this document.

Misc has two subdirectories:
1. sub: contains smaller subsets of the bigger datasets 
2. rid: lists of read IDs for selected chromosomes (useful for grabbing through slow5curl)

Note that only selected datasets would have these miscalleneous data and are added upon request. The file names would have the an identifier which could be related to its parent BLOW5 file. FOr instance any miscallaneous data files for the parent BLOW5 file named PGXXSX240041_reads.blow5 would contain PGXXSX240041 in the file name.
